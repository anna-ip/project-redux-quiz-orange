A quiz built with Redux as a group project


A quiz where the user get a random rendered subject with 5 questions.


This quiz was built as a group project in React and Redux, both practicing working in branches and mob-programming, using and practising Redux; dispatch and useSelector as weel as working with small components.
We planed the project beforehand, and sticked to the plan all through the project. If there would have been more time we would have worked more on the CSS and added som animations or Giffs.
